Random generator for DnD

Has three different generators

1 - Jojo's bizzare generator  The whole point of this program, it gives you flat distribution statlines
2 - Standard                  The standard rule 7 x 3d6, drops lowest total 
3 - Weakling                  Weakling rulse, 7 x 4d6, drops lowest die each time, then drops lowest total

You can set a seed for the random generator, or if you leave it blank it will use the system time

Logs multiple rolls for comparison
